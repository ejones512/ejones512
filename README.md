- 👋 Hi, I’m @ejones512 a.k.a. Erin Jones (Austin, TX)
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how people are using our Dynatrace action (and what else we could share on GitHub that would be of value).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how Dynatrace and our integrations can create value for DevOps teams.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any of the above! I'm all ears for anything that could help me or Dynatrace do better.
- 📫 How to reach me: erin.jones@dynatrace.com
